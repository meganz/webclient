If MEGA does not receive any further communication from or on behalf of the person who originally submitted the takedown notice, or such communication that it does receive does not in MEGA\u2019s sole opinion adequately justify the original takedown notice, MEGA may, but shall not be obliged to, reinstate the material in approximately 10-14 business days provided it has no reason to believe that the material infringes copyright.",

    "23072": "MEGA was launched on January 20, 2013 - exactly one year after the infamous destruction of Megaupload by the US Government. It was founded by the same people who had created Megaupload, including Kim Dotcom, Mathias Ortmann and Bram van der Kolk.",
    "23073": "Dotcom, while not involved in MEGA's design or technical implementation, excelled at marketing and fundraising. Within a year, he had sold most of his shareholding and stepped down as a Director to pursue new goals.",
    "23074": "Many people see MEGA as the natural reincarnation of Megaupload, but the reality is a lot more nuanced. While the expertise from running a large scale cloud storage service like Megaupload assisted in the architectural design, MEGA's product is fundamentally more sophisticated in every conceivable way.",
    "23075": "Furthermore, owing to its controversial background, MEGA has invested heavily in compliance under the guidance of its global legal advisers. MEGA enforces its [A1]Terms of Service[\/A1] strictly and provides a [A2]Takedown Guidance[\/A2]. MEGA also periodically publishes a [A3]transparency report[\/A3].",

    "23123": "Technical issues are a fact of life. Hard disks fail on a daily basis. Sometimes, an entire server goes down. And despite the best efforts of our datacentre operators and fibre carriers, power outages and fibre cuts happen more often than not.",
    "23124": "We do not want you to have to worry about such mishaps. We want you to be able to access your files 24\/7, even while an entire country we host in has gone offline (which we hope won't ever happen).",
    "23125": "What's the solution?",
    "23126": "The solution is simple: we split each file into roughly equal-sized parts and store each of them in a different country. We also store another part (in yet another country) recording whether the number of \"1\" bits at a certain position within all parts is even or odd.[BR]This means that you can reconstruct your data even when one of the parts is unavailable. And best of all, your browser can connect directly to all datacentres and reassemble your file thanks to our unique JavaScript on-the-fly transfer processing engine that we also use for our end-to-end cryptography.",
