                <span class="number">1</span>
                <span class="text">Welcome to Mega. Mega Limited ("Mega", "we", "us") provides internet services.  We provide services ourselves and via our related companies, affiliates and resellers who act on our behalf, at our website at https://mega.nz, subdomains and related sites (each a "website"), and using mobile apps we provide ("our mobile apps"), which enable users, amongst other things, to encrypt by way of user controlled encryption ("UCE"), use our application programming interface ("API"), upload, store, manage, download and decrypt files, information, material and other data ("data") and give access to that data to others (all together, "services" and each, a "service"). If you have questions about how to use our services or the great things you can do with Mega, check our Help Centre or, if you can't find the answer there, email us at <a href="mailto:support@mega.nz">support@mega.nz</a>.</span>

                <span class="text">These terms are binding and apply to any use of the services, website and our mobile apps by you and anyone who you allow to access your data or our services. By using our services, the website or our mobile apps, you and they irrevocably agree to these terms. If you do not like these terms or don't want to be bound, you can't use our services, the website or our mobile apps.  In particular, OUR SERVICES ARE PROVIDED SUBJECT TO CERTAIN DISCLAIMERS BY US AND UNDERTAKINGS BY YOU, INCLUDING AN INDEMNITY FROM YOU IF YOU BREACH THESE TERMS &ndash; see clauses 37-47.  NEW ZEALAND LAW AND ARBITRATION OF ANY DISPUTES APPLIES EXCLUSIVELY &ndash; see clauses 48 and 49.</span>

                <span class="number">3</span>
                <span class="text">We can change these terms at any time by providing you at least 30 days' prior notice of the change, whether via our website, via our mobile apps, by sending you an email or via any messaging service we provide. Your continued use after that notice means that you agree to the changed terms. If you have paid for a subscription that is due to expire after that 30 day notice period and you do not wish to continue to use our services under the new terms, you may terminate your subscription before the new terms come into force.  We will then (but not otherwise) refund the unexpired portion of your subscription payment within 30 days and close your account.</span>

                <span class="text">Our service includes UCE. You should keep your password and encryption keys safe and confidential. You must not share your password with anyone else and should not release encryption keys to anyone else unless you wish them to have access to your data. If you lose or misplace your password, you will lose access to your data. We strongly urge you to use best practices for ensuring the safety of your system and devices (e.g. via security upgrades, firewall protection, anti-virus software, securing your devices).  Mega will never send you emails asking for your password or suggesting that you click a link to login to your account, so do not be fooled by any such email since it will not be from us.</span>

In that case, the original file will be accessed by you and any other user and that file will be retained for so long as any user has a right to access it under these terms.</span>

If you choose to stop using our services, you need to make sure you download your data first because after that we may, if we wish, delete it. If we suspend our services to you because you have breached these terms, or someone you have given access to has breached these terms, during the term of that suspension, we may, if we wish, deny you access to your data but keep it for evidential purposes. If we terminate our services to you because you or someone you have given access to has breached these terms, we may, if we wish, delete your data immediately or keep it for evidential purposes. In circumstances where we cease providing our services for other reasons, we will, if reasonably practicable and we are not prevented by law or likely to incur any liability in doing so, give you 30 days' notice to retrieve your data.</span>
