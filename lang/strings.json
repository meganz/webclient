Share folders with your contacts and see their updates in real time.\r\n\r\nThe encryption process means we cannot access or reset your password so you MUST remember it (unless you have your Recovery Key backed up) or you will lose access to your stored files.\r\n\r\nInside the app you can upgrade your storage space and bandwidth quota with a monthly or yearly subscription.\r\n\r\nPRO LITE subscription: \u20ac4.99 (US$4.99) per month or \u20ac49.99 (US$49.99) per year gives you 200 GB of storage space and 1 TB of bandwidth per month.\r\nPRO I subscription: \u20ac9.99 (US$9.99) per month or \u20ac99.99 (US$99.99) per year gives you 500 GB of storage space and 2 TB of bandwidth per month.\r\nPRO II subscription: \u20ac19.99 (US$19.99) per month or \u20ac199.99 (US$199.99) per year gives you 2 TB of storage space and 4 TB of bandwidth per month.\r\nPRO III subscription: \u20ac29.99 (US$29.99) per month or \u20ac299.99 (US$299.99) per year gives you 4 TB of storage space and 8 TB of bandwidth per month.\r\n\r\nFor more info, please check our website:\r\nMobile - https:\/\/mega.nz\/mobile_terms.html\thttps:\/\/mega.nz\/mobile_privacy.html\r\nDesktop - https:\/\/mega.nz\/\r\n\r\nNote: For desktop access to your files MEGA needs to use HTML5 compatible browsers to handle our advanced features.
