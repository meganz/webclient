Edward Snowden's revelations 137 days later fundamentally changed public attitudes and it became excruciatingly clear that <i>security by policy<\/i> (\"we have access to your data, but we promise to keep it confidential and not misuse it\") had not been good enough. Anything short of <i>security by design<\/i> (\"we cannot gain access to your data without you being able to find out\"), for which strong end-to-end encryption is an essential prerequisite, now seems grossly insufficient.",
    "1822": "MEGA was architected around the simple fact that cryptography, for it to be accepted and used, must not interfere with usability. MEGA is fully accessible without prior software installs and remains the only cloud storage provider with browser-based high-performance end-to-end encryption. The only visible signs of the crypto layer operating under MEGA's hood are the entropy collection during signup, the lack of a password reset feature and the novel (and browser-specific) ways file transfers are conducted. Today, millions of business and personal users rely on MEGA to securely and reliably store and serve petabytes of data and we believe that this success is the result of MEGA's low barrier to entry to a more secure cloud.",

During the installation, you will be asked to enter or create your MEGA account and to set up the folders to replicate (either your full MEGA cloud drive and folder structure to a single local folder location or specific subfolders in your cloud drive to corresponding local folders). After the installation completes, MEGAsync will start automatically. You will see a clickable MEGA logo in your system tray or menu bar while the sync tool is running that gives you access to a status popup and the settings page.",
    "1829": "Can I use MEGAsync on multiple computers?",
    "1831": "How can I monitor the sync status of my local files and folders?",
    "1833": "MEGAsync stores my login credentials to perform autologin. Isn't that a security concern?",
    "1838": "On the cloud side, deleted files will be moved to a special \"SyncDebris\" subfolder structure in your rubbish bin and can be retrieved from there (use MEGA's built-in search if needed). On the local computer, each sync's root folder will have a hidden \"Debris\" or \".rubbish\" folder in which deleted items are placed.",
    "1839": "Does MEGAsync perform explicit file versioning?",
    "1840": "No. However, you can access overwritten files in the respective debris folders until they are purged.",

    "1845": "Are there any restrictions with regards to filenames?",
    "1849": "How can I make sure that I always have the latest version of MEGAsync?",
    "1851": "Will MEGAsync use peer-to-peer transfers to achieve faster syncing between computers in the same local area network?",
    "1852": "No. The current incarnation of MEGAsync always syncs via MEGA's cloud infrastructure.",
    "1853": "What happens if conflicting concurrent actions are performed on clients synced to the same cloud location?",
    "1854": "The current version of MEGAsync does not resolve such clashes in a deterministic manner. Avoid them if possible.",

    "1858": "No, unless you want to run multiple MEGAsync processes in parallel, which is not recommended. As a general rule, each filesystem item must only be visible to MEGAsync once, so avoid syncing subfolders of synced folders or placing multiple links to the same filesystem item in a local synced folder.",
