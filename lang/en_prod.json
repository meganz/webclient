If MEGA does not receive any further communication from or on behalf of the person who originally submitted the takedown notice, or such communication that it does receive does not in MEGA\u2019s sole opinion adequately justify the original takedown notice, MEGA may, but shall not be obliged to, reinstate the material in approximately 10-14 business days provided it has no reason to believe that the material infringes copyright.",

While the expertise from running a large scale cloud storage service like Megaupload assisted in the architectural design, MEGA\u2019s product is fundamentally more sophisticated in every conceivable way.",
    "23075": "Furthermore, owing to its controversial background, MEGA has invested heavily in compliance under the guidance of its global legal advisers.
