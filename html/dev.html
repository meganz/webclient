              <p>Welcome to the MEGA SDK! We hope that it will prove useful to developers who are interested in integrating MEGA support into their applications.</p>
              <h2 id="doc_1">
                <span class="number">1</span>
                <span class="text"> What is the MEGA SDK good for?</span>
              </h2>
              <p>The MEGA SDK consists of code and documentation that enables you to make use of MEGA's API functionality at a comfortably high level of abstraction. Its core component &mdash; a code module called <i>client access engine</i> &mdash; maintains a current copy of the user's account in memory (which includes all relevant files, folders, contacts and shares), accepts commands from the application and notifies the application of command results and other updates through callbacks.</p>
              <h2>
                <span class="number">2</span>
                <span class="text">How do I use the MEGA client access engine?</span>
              </h2>
              <p>The MEGA client access engine comes as a set of C++ classes and interfaces. If you are using C++, you can simply add them to your project. You then instantiate the MegaClient class (which holds the session state) and pass it an instance of your implementation of the HttpIO interface (which handles network requests and blocking) and MegaApp (through which you receive the engine's callbacks).</p>
              <p>The core code is reasonably platform independent (if you encounter any issues with your specific C++ compiler environment, please let us know). To illustrate practical usage, a sample application (a basic ftp-style interactive console client) is included.</p>
              <h2>
                <span class="number">3</span>
                <span class="text">Why do you provide a code module rather than documenting the API interface in sufficient detail for me to implement it myself?</span>
              </h2>
              <p>Two reasons:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Complexity/efficiency &mdash; Since all of MEGA's crypto logic runs on the client side, you'd be looking at a project exceeding 5,000 lines of code. And, as natural language is rather inefficient when it comes to specifying algorithms, the documentation would be similarly voluminous.</li>
                <li>Consistency/interoperability &mdash; Ambiguities in the specification or its imprecise interpretation would inevitably lead to undesired behavioural differences between implementations.</li>
              </ul>
              <h2>
                <span class="number">4</span>
                <span class="text">Thanks, but why C++? I am using C, Objective C, C#, Java, Scala, Python, Ruby, Perl, PHP, VB...</span>
              </h2>
              <p>The requirement to integrate with projects that compile to native code rules out all languages that rely on specific interpreters or runtime environments. C, being the "lingua franca" of nearly all modern systems, would have been the obvious choice, but the code compactness and readability benefits provided by C++'s syntactic sugar and template library are well worth the minor additional integration overhead. We will work with interested developers to add MEGA support to their preferred environments by way of native code modules/extensions (rather than by porting the functionality to the target language itself). Please contact us at <a href="mailto:developers@mega.nz">developers@mega.nz</a> if you are willing and able to contribute to a particular integration effort.</p>

                <span class="text">Interaction</span>
              </h2>
              <p>The application submits requests to the client access engine through nonblocking calls to methods of the MegaClient object and signals events to the application by invoking methods of an object of its implementation of the MegaApp interface.</p>
              <h2 class="list">

                <span class="text">Files and folders</span>
              </h2>
              <p>Files and folders are represented by Node objects and referenced by node handles. Nodes point to parent nodes, forming trees. Trees have exactly one root node (circular linkage is not allowed). Node updates (caused by the session's own actions, other sessions of the same account or other accounts, e.g. through activity in a shared folder) are notified in real time through a callback specifying the affected nodes. Deleted nodes are first notified with their removed flag set before being purged to give the application an opportunity to remove them from the UI view.</p>
              <p>There are at least three node trees per account: Root, incoming and rubbish. Additional trees can originate from other users as shared folders.</p>
              <h2 class="list">
                <span class="number">5.3</span>
                <span class="text">Users and contacts</span>
              </h2>
              <p>Users are referenced by their user handle and/or their primary e-mail address. The engine maintains a User object for every user account that has appeared in the context of the current session: As a contact or merely as the owner of a filesystem node. A visibility flag turns a user into a contact if set.</p>
              <p>User attributes can be used to store credentials such as avatar pictures, address, date of birth etc. It is recommended to store application-private user credentials AES-CBC encrypted.</p>

                <span class="text">Asynchronous completion</span>
              </h2>
              <p>All engine methods are nonblocking &mdash; waiting for network communication to complete is not an option. Instead, they merely initiate the desired action, the outcome of which is eventually signalled through a callback. The application should be robust against such callbacks arriving after a long time (i.e., many seconds). Failed requests (e.g. due to network issues) are retried automatically with exponential backoff. The application receives notification of this through a callback and should inform the user accordingly, along with a UI element to manually initiate a retry.</p>
              <p>Three types of operation are subject to acceleration by a mechanism called "speculative instant completion": Node attribute updates, moves and deletions. As these merely receive a highly predictable "OK" or "failure" response from the API, there is some benefit in immediately updating the local nodes and reloading the session state in the rare event of an inconsistency. The engine loosely protects them with an access check that is following the same semantics as the authoritative check on the API server side.</p>
              <h2 class="list">
                <span class="number">5.5</span>
                <span class="text">Concurrency considerations</span>
              </h2>
              <p>Shared access to a resource (writable nodes accessible to the user's account) based on a potentially outdated (due to network latency) view is naturally prone to race conditions, leading to inconsistencies when two parties make conflicting updates within the latency window. The engine contains heuristics to detect these conflicts and will ask the application to discard and reload its view if needed (the user should be informed accordingly).</p>
              <h2 class="list">
                <span class="number">5.6</span>
                <span class="text">Event processing and threading</span>
              </h2>
              <p>Due to its nonblocking nature, the MEGA client access engine integrates extremely well with single-threaded applications (although on platforms without a nonblocking DNS lookup facility, you may not get around using a worker thread for name resolution). If you, however, prefer to use multiple threads, you are welcome to do so - as long as you ensure that no two threads get to enter the engine or access its data structures at the same time.</p>

              <p>There are three approaches to integrating the engine with the application. The goal is to have the engine get the CPU (through MegaClient's exec() method) swiftly whenever one of its wakeup triggers fires: </p>
              <ul>
                <li>block inside the engine's own blocking callback (which waits for socket I/O and timeouts) and include the application's own wakeup triggers</li>
                <li>record the engine's wakeup triggers and include them in the application's existing blocking facility</li>
                <li>dedicate a worker thread to the MEGA engine and interact with the application through e.g. a bidirectional message queue (inefficient, but the only option if, for some reason, you cannot modify the application's event processing)</li>

              <p>Applications must be prepared to deal with file and folder name clashes. In many scenarios, this is trivial - the user sees all copies and makes the decision which file he is interested in, mostly based on its timestamp. Some applications, however, map a MEGA node tree to a resource that uses file paths as unique keys, e.g. filesystems. In this case, we recommend that only the most recent node is used.</p>
              <p>Filename characters that are not allowed on the host must be urlencoded using %xx. When writing files back to the server, valid urlencoded sequences must be replaced with the encoded character. This has the potential unwanted side effect of mangling filenames that originally contained valid %xx sequences, but this should be rare, and they'll be unmangled when read back to the local machine.</p>

              </h2>
              <p>To access MEGA, an application needs to instantiate three classes: </p>
              <ul>
                <li>its own implementation of the
                  <c>MegaApp</c>
                  interface</li>
                <li>its own implementation of the
                  <c>HttpIO</c>
                  interface</li>
                <li>
                  <c>MegaClient</c>
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>Then, the application must call
                <c>MegaClient</c>
                's
                <c>wait()</c>
                immediately before or instead of blocking for events itself. If
                <c>wait()</c>
                wishes to block, it calls
                <c>HttpIO</c>
                's
                <c>waitio()</c>
                , supplying a timeout. The application can either piggyback its own wakeup criteria onto the socket events/timeout in
                <c>waitio()</c>
                , or record the criteria
                <c>waitio()</c>
                gets waken up by and include these in its own blocking logic. The supplied SDK example (megaapp.cpp) uses the former approach, adding
                <c>fileno(stdin)</c>
                to the
                <c>select()</c>

              <p>The application must call MegaClient's
                <c>exec()</c>
                at least once after every wakeup by the
                <c>waitio()</c>
                criteria (it doesn't hurt to call it too often).</p>

              <p>Multiple concurrent file transfers are supported. It is strongly suggested not to run more than one large upload and one large download in parallel to avoid network congestion (there will be little, if any, speed benefit). A file transfer can aggregate multiple TCP channels (recommended starting point: 4) for greater throughput. File transfers can be aborted at any time by calling
                <c>MegaClient::tclose()</c>
                . Significant local network congestion during uploads is common with ADSL uplinks and can be prevented by enabling an automatic or fixed rate limit.</p>

              <p>Applications that transfer batches of files should do using the engine's transfer queueing functionality.

Failed transfers are retried with exponential backoff.</p>

              <p>All applications capable of uploading image files <i>should</i> add thumbnails in the process (remember that there is no way for us to do this on the server side). Thumbnails are stored as type 0 file attributes and should be 120p*120p JPEGs compressed to around 3-4 KB. The sample application supplied with the SDK demonstrates how to do this using the <a href="http://freeimage.sourceforge.net/" target="_new">FreeImage</a> library.

              <p>There are two types of quota limitations an application can encounter during its operation: Storage and bandwidth.  MEGA, by policy, is quite generous on both, which means that only a small fraction of your user base will ever run out of quota, but it is essential that if it happens, the situation is handled correctly - the user needs to be informed about the reason for his upload or download failing rather than being left in the dark with what looks like a malfunction.</p>

                <li>Maintaining the account state in a local persistent database rather than in memory. Upon login, the client would ask the server for the number of operations that have affected the account since the last database update, and then decide whether it is more efficient to wipe the local state and reload, or to continue with the stored state and apply the queued updates to it (in the vast majority of cases, it will be the latter).</li>

              </h2>
              <p>Knowledge of the following low-level details is not required to successfully develop MEGA client applications. It is provided as a reference to those who are interested in fully understanding how MEGA's API works.</p>

                <span class="text">Communication protocol</span>
              </h2>
              <p>The MEGA API is based on a simple HTTP/JSON request-response scheme. Requests are submitted as arrays of command objects and can be initiated by both the client and the server, effectively resulting in bidirectional RPC capability. To see the raw request flow in the SDK's megaclient sample app, use the debug command.</p>

                <span class="number">12.2</span>
                <span class="text">Cryptography</span>
              </h2>
              <p>All symmetric cryptographic operations are based on AES-128. It operates in cipher block chaining mode for the file and folder attribute blocks and in counter mode for the actual file data. Each file and each folder node uses its own randomly generated 128 bit key. File nodes use the same key for the attribute block and the file data, plus a 64 bit random counter start value and a 64 bit meta MAC to verify the file's integrity.</p>
              <p>Each user account uses a symmetric master key to ECB-encrypt all keys of the nodes it keeps in its own trees. This master key is stored on MEGA's servers, encrypted with a hash derived from the user's login password.</p>
              <p>File integrity is verified using chunked CBC-MAC. Chunk sizes start at 128 KB and increase to 1 MB, which is a reasonable balance between space required to store the chunk MACs and the average overhead for integrity-checking partial reads.</p>
              <p>In addition to the symmetric key, each user account has a 2048 bit RSA key pair to securely receive data such as share keys or file/folder keys. Its private component is stored encrypted with the user's symmetric master key.</p>

                <span class="text">Shared folders</span>
              </h2>
              <p>The owner of the folder is solely responsible for managing access; shares are non-transitive (shares cannot be created on folders in incoming shares). All participants in a shared folder gain cryptographic access through a common share-specific key, which is passed from the owner (theoretically, from anyone participating in the share, but this would create a significant security risk in the event of a compromise of the core infrastructure) to new participants through RSA. All keys of the nodes in a shared folder, including its root node, are encrypted to this share key. The party adding a new node to a shared folder is responsible for supplying the appropriate node/share-specific key. Missing node/share-specific keys can only be supplied by the share owner.</p>

              </h2>
              <p>MEGA supports secure unauthenticated data delivery. Any fully registered user can receive files or folders in their inbox through their RSA public key.</p>

              </h2>
              <p>Each login starts a new session. For regular accounts, this involves the server generating a random session token and encrypting it to the user's private key. The user password is considered verified if it successfully decrypts the private key, which then decrypts the session token.</p>
              <p>To prevent remote offline dictionary attacks on a user's password, the encrypted private key is only supplied to the client if a hash derived from the password is presented to the server.</p>

                <span class="text">API request flow and execution</span>
              </h2>
              <p>API requests flow in two directions: client &rarrow; server and server &rarrow; client</p>
              <p>Client-server requests are issued as HTTP POST with a raw JSON payload. A request consists of one or multiple commands and is executed as a single atomic, isolated and consistent transaction - in the event of a request-level error response, no data was altered. Requests are idempotent - sending the same request multiple times is equivalent to sending it once, which makes it safe to retry them, e.g. in case of intermittent network issues. Each request must therefore be tagged with a session-unique identifier (e.g., a sequence number) to prevent inadvertent cache hits caused by preceding identical requests.</p>
              <p>While a request is executed, all users that may be affected by it are locked. This includes the requesting user and all users that are in a shared folder relationship and/or in the contact list. A request may return the error code EAGAIN in the event of a failed locking attempt or a temporary server-side malfunction. The request is likely to complete when retried. Client applications must implement exponential backoff (with user-triggerable immediate retry) and should inform the user of a possible server or network issue if the EAGAIN condition persists or no response is received for more than a few seconds.</p>
              <p>A successfully executed request returns an array of result objects, with each result appearing in the same array index location as the corresponding command.</p>

              <p>To prevent infrastructure overload, dynamic rate limiting is in effect. Before a request is executed, the total "weight" of the commands it contains is computed and checked against the current balance of the requesting IP address. If the total exceeds a defined threshold, the request is rejected as a whole and must be repeated with exponential backoff</p>

                <span class="text">File encryption</span>
              </h2>
              <p> MEGA uses client-side encryption/decryption to end-to-end-protect file transfers and storage. Data received from clients is stored and transmitted verbatim; servers neither decrypt, nor re-encrypt, nor verify the encryption of incoming user files. All cryptographic processing is under the control of the end user.<br>
                To allow for integrity-checked partial reads, a file is treated as a series of chunks. To simplify server-side processing, partial uploads can only start and end on a chunk boundary. Furthermore, partial downloads can only be integrity-checked if they fulfil the same criterion.<br>
                Chunk boundaries are located at the following positions:<br>
                0 / 128K / 384K / 768K / 1280K / 1920K / 2688K / 3584K / 4608K / ... (every 1024 KB) / EOF<br>
                A file key is 256 bits long and consists of the following components:<br>
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>A 128 bit AES-128 key k</li>
                <li>The upper 64 bit n of the counter start value (the lower 64 bit are starting at 0 and incrementing by 1 for each AES block of 16 bytes)</li>
                <li>A 64 bit meta-MAC m of all chunk MACs</li>
              </ul>
              <p> A chunk MAC is computed as follows (this is essentially CBC-MAC, which was chosen instead of the more efficient OCB over intellectual property concerns):<br>
                h := (n &lt;&lt; 64) + n<br>
                For each AES block d: h := AES(k,h XOR d)<br>
                A chunk is encrypted using standard counter mode:<br>
                For each AES block d at block position p: d' := d XOR AES(k,(n &lt;&lt; 64)+p)<br>
                MAC computation and encryption can be performed in the same loop.<br>
                Decryption is analogous.<br>
                To obtain the meta-MAC m, apply the same CBC-MAC to the resulting block MACs with a start value of 0. The 64 bit meta-MAC m is computed as ((bits 0-31 XOR bits 32-63) &lt;&lt; 64) + (bits 64-95 XOR bits 96-127). </p>

              <p>Uploads are performed by POSTing raw data to the target URL returned by the API u command. If so desired, an upload can be performed in chunks. Chunks can be sent in any order and can be of any size, but they must begin and end on a chunk boundary. The byte offset x of a chunk within the file is indicated by appending /x to the URL. Multiple chunks can be sent in parallel. After a chunk completes, the server responds with a status message, which can be:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Empty - successful receipt</li>
                <li>A (negative) error code in decimal ASCII representation, typically requiring a restart of the upload from scratch</li>
                <li>A 27-character base64-encoded completion handle that must be used in conjunction with the p (put node) API command to complete the upload</li>
              </ul>
              <p> The per-upload encryption key must be generated by a strong random number generator. Using a weak one will undermine the confidentiality and integrity of your data. </p>

              </h2>
              <p> All MEGA servers support HTTPS access - this is due to many web browsers enforcing a policy where HTTP requests cannot be made from an HTTPS page at all (IE, Firefox 18+) or at least trigger a visual warning (Chrome, Firefox until 17). However, only two types of requests actually benefit from and therefore require HTTPS: The loading of https://mega.nz/index.html and the API request interface. Neither the hash-protected loading of static .html and .js components, nor the waiting for new server-client requests, nor already encrypted and MAC'ed data transfers from and to the storage cluster benefit from HTTPS in any meaningful way. Client applications are therefore required to use SSL for access to the API interface, but strongly discouraged from doing so for wait requests and bulk file transfers.<br>
              </p>
              <p>MEGA's HTTPS access supports most ciphers/hashes and uses strong 2048 bit RSA where SSL is relevant (i.e. on the root HTML and the API servers) and RC4/MD5 with CPU-saving 1024 bit RSA where it is not (i.e. on static HTML and storage servers).<br>
              </p>
              <p>PFS ("perfect forward secrecy") is supported on the API servers only, because secrecy is not required for public static content. </p>
