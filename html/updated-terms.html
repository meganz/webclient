Your continued use after that notice means that you agree to the changed terms. If you have paid for a subscription that is due to expire after that 30 day notice period and you do not wish to continue to use our services under the new terms, you may terminate your subscription before the new terms come into force. We will then (but not otherwise) refund the unexpired portion of your subscription payment within 30 days and close your account.

                    UCE is fundamental to our services. This means that you, not us, have encrypted control of who has access to your data. You should keep your password and Recovery Key safe and confidential. You must not share your password with anyone else and should not release encryption keys to anyone else unless you wish them to have access to your data. <b>If you lose or misplace your password, you will lose access to your data</b>. Encryption won&rsquo;t help though if someone has full access to your system or device. We strongly urge you to use best practices for ensuring the safety and security of your system and devices (e.g. via unique passwords, security upgrades, firewall protection, anti-virus software, securing and encrypting your devices). Mega will never send you emails asking for your password so do not be fooled by any such email since it will not be from us.

In that case, the original file will be accessed by you and any other user and that file will be retained as long as any user has a right to access it under these terms. Any right of deletion that you exercise will not apply to a deduplicated file that is associated with another user.

We will consider usage to be excessive and unreasonable where it materially exceeds the average and/or estimated use patterns over any day, week or month (or other period of time as determined by us) (&ldquo;<b>excessive usage</b>&rdquo;). If we identify excessive usage or consider that usage patterns on any business account indicate that any of the usage is not for business purposes we may suspend, and after 30 days&rsquo; notice, terminate any or all of the users or the whole business account, in which case data and personal information associated with those users and the account will be subject to deletion in accordance with these terms. Examples of such unreasonable usage patterns also include: making non-business data publicly available, adding users who do not appear to Mega to be associated with the business, and uploading or sharing files from non-business related third party sites.
