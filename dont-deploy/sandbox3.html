         * Devboot is a temp solution that is used for testing purposes
         * ... (no PHP there ;)). So if anyone wonders whats the
         * "dont-deploy" folder, it contains stuff which are used for
         * development/debugging/internal demo purposes and it should
         * not be deployed to production.
         * 
         * The devboot.html also setups the localStorage so that:
         * 
         * 0) Clear the localStorage
         * 
         * 1) Debug mode is enabled - e.g. a lot of stuff will be
         *    printed in the dev console, via console.* and the
         *    MegaLogger.
         * 
         * 2) Static path is dynamically set to ../../ (relative to
         *    dont-deploy/devboot.html). This means that the staticPath
         *    should be correctly set even if you have your project
         *    running in localhost/meganz-webclient/ or customVhost/ +
         *    it will work with http OR https.
         * 
         * 3) Will enable the megaChat (<-- major thing, may change a
         *    lot of stuff)
         * 
         * 4) Will force the secureboot to load the actual .js files
         *    instead of just pushing ALL javascript files into a single
         *    blog: (this was really helpful for debugging the JS code
         *    using the Chrome debugger).
         * 
         * 5) Will enable stopOnAssertFail, which in case of assertion
         *    fail (mainly in the chat.js code) will run a debugger;
         *    (something pretty handy during development)
