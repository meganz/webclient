    "8773": "MEGA processes all takedown notices submitted to us based on good faith acceptance of the representations from the party submitting the takedown notice. Due to our end-to-end encryption model we have to do so without being able to review the files. Even if we could decrypt them, we could not determine the copyright status without complex analysis and review, which is impractical for the number of files processed each day. We are aware that some agencies submit incorrect takedown notices from time to time, but we are unable to find such errors in advance.",
    "8774": "You may file a counter-notice if you believe that access to a file you have uploaded has been wrongly disabled because it was the subject of an incorrect takedown notice. You should only do so if you are confident that no other party owns copyright in the material, or you have rights to store the material and, if you are sharing it, that you have the right to do so.",
    "8775": "We can only accept counter-notifications directly from the user whose MEGA account the disabled URL or file refers to. Counter-notifications must be submitted from the email address associated with the MEGA account subject to URL or content take-down.",
    "8776": "Upon receipt of a counter-notification, MEGA will promptly provide the person who provided the takedown notification with a copy of the counter-notification, and inform that person that MEGA will replace the removed material or cease disabling access to it in 10 business days. If MEGA does not receive any further communication from or on behalf of the person who originally submitted the takedown notice, or such communication that it does receive does not in MEGA\u2019s sole opinion adequately justify the original takedown notice, MEGA may, but shall not be obliged to, reinstate the material in approximately 10-14 business days provided it has no reason to believe that the material infringes copyright.",

    "20008": "All your data on MEGA is encrypted with a key derived from your password. MEGA does not have access to your password or your data.",
    "20009": "If you lose your password, you lose your data.",
    "20010": "Use a strong unique password, but don\u2019t lose it",
    "20011": "The stronger your password, the more secure your encryption. Many password managers provide a feature to generate a strong unique password, e.g. [A]https://www.lastpass.com/password-generator[/A]",
    "20012": "The use of a password manager is recommended",
    "20013": "A strong, unique password is hard to remember. However, if you forget it, you will lose access to your MEGA data.[Br]That is why MEGA recommends the use of a password manager, such as:",
    "20014": "In case you do lose your password, having access to the recovery key allows you to reset your password. We recommend you print it, store it on a USB key or save it to your password manager.",
    "20015": "When you are logged in you can back up your recovery key here: [A]https://mega.nz/keybackup[/A]",
    "20016": "We recommend you enable two-factor authentication for an additional layer of security. Learn more here: [A]https://mega.nz/blog_48[/A]. [Br]MEGA recommends the use of one of the following authenticators:",
    "20017": "Endpoint encryption",
    "20018": "MEGA does not encrypt the client device of the user. MEGA recommends the use of a strong screen passphrase and device-level full-disk encryption, which is now enabled by default on new Android and iOS devices.",
    "20019": "Endpoint security",
    "20020": "MEGA\u2019s end-to-end encryption (E2EE) paradigm enhances the overall security by providing privacy by design, unlike many of its competitors who only provide privacy by policy, but it is not a silver bullet solution to all potential security threats. It is critical that the endpoint devices are secure as any breach on an endpoint device can break the E2EE chain.",
    "20022": "For example, a backdoor or virus on the user\u2019s endpoint device\u2019s operating system could allow a rogue attacker to intercept unencrypted data, log keystrokes or directly capture audio/video from the device\u2019s microphone/camera.[Br]It is therefore important that the user does not solely rely on MEGA, but also ensures that their endpoint devices (on which the user runs the MEGA client software) are secure.",

While the expertise from running a large scale cloud storage service like Megaupload assisted in the architectural design, MEGA\u2019s product is fundamentally more sophisticated in every conceivable way.",
    "23075": "Furthermore, owing to its controversial background, MEGA has invested heavily in compliance under the guidance of its global legal advisers.
