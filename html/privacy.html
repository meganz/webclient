             If we think it is necessary or we have to by law in any jurisdiction then we are entitled to give your information to the authorities. We reserve the right to assist any law enforcement agency with investigations, including and limited to by way of disclosure of information to them or their agents. We also reserve the right to comply with any legal processes, including but not limited to subpoenas, search warrants and court orders. We may disclose your information to enforce or apply our <a href="ios_terms.html">Terms</a> or any other agreement we have with you; or to protect the rights, property, or safety of us or our other users or the operation of our services and the website.

             We will not sell or otherwise provide your personal information to a third party other than our authorised resellers and service providers, or make any other use of personal information for any purpose which is not specifically allowed under this Policy or our <a href="">Terms</a> or is not incidental to the normal use of our services.

           <p>
             We strongly urge you to use robust anti virus and firewall protection as we cannot guarantee the security of transmission from and to your computer over the Internet and thus cannot guarantee there will be no unauthorised access. Also, if you lose or otherwise allow access to your encryption keys, you will lose the security of your data. In addition if you misplace or forget your encryption keys we have no ability to recover them for you, you will lose access to your data.
