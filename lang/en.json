The only visible signs of the crypto layer operating under MEGA\u2019s hood are the entropy collection during signup, the lack of a password reset feature and the novel (and browser-specific) ways file transfers are conducted. Today, millions of business and personal users rely on MEGA to securely and reliably store and serve petabytes of data and we believe that this success is the result of MEGA\u2019s low barrier to entry to a more secure cloud.",

    "8773": "MEGA processes all takedown notices submitted to us based on good faith acceptance of the representations from the party submitting the takedown notice. Due to our end-to-end encryption model we have to do so without being able to review the files. Even if we could decrypt them, we could not determine the copyright status without complex analysis and review, which is impractical for the number of files processed each day. We are aware that some agencies submit incorrect takedown notices from time to time, but we are unable to find such errors in advance.",
    "8774": "You may file a counter-notice if you believe that access to a file you have uploaded has been wrongly disabled because it was the subject of an incorrect takedown notice. You should only do so if you are confident that no other party owns copyright in the material, or you have rights to store the material and, if you are sharing it, that you have the right to do so.",
    "8775": "We can only accept a counter-notification directly from the user from whose MEGA account the URL or file has been disabled. For verification, counter-notifications must be submitted from the email address associated with the MEGA account.",
    "8776": "Upon receipt of a counter-notification, MEGA will promptly provide the person who provided the takedown notification with a copy of the counter-notification, and inform that person that MEGA will replace the removed material or cease disabling access to it in 10 business days. If MEGA does not receive any further communication from or on behalf of the person who originally submitted the takedown notice, or such communication that it does receive does not in MEGA\u2019s sole opinion adequately justify the original takedown notice, MEGA may, but shall not be obliged to, reinstate the material in approximately 10-14 business days provided it has no reason to believe that the material infringes copyright.",
