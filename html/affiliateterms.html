<h2> MEGA AFFILIATE NETWORK AGREEMENT</h2>
 
<p>This MEGA Affiliate Network Agreement, together with the Program Rules (as defined below) and any other documents or materials referenced or incorporated herein (collectively, the "<strong>Agreement</strong>") constitutes a binding agreement that governs your participation in the MEGA Affiliate Network Program operated by MEGA LIMITED ("<strong>MEGA</strong>"). As used in this <strong>Agreement</strong>, "<strong>we</strong>", "<strong>us</strong>", or "<strong>our</strong>" means MEGA, and "<strong>Affiliate</strong>", "<strong>you</strong>" or "<strong>your</strong>" means the person or entity entering into this Agreement to participate in the Affiliate Program.</p>


<p>MEGA administers the Affiliate Network Program ("<strong>Affiliate Program</strong>") on behalf of itself and subsidiaries (the "<strong>MEGA Entities</strong>") that operate websites (each, a "<strong>MEGA Site</strong>").</p>

<p>The Affiliate Program allows Affiliates to refer internet traffic to a MEGA Site from website(s), App(s), or advertising networks owned or controlled by the Affiliate ("<strong>Affiliate Site</strong>) using a Special Link (defined below). If such traffic results in an Action (as defined below), Affiliates may be paid a commission ("<strong>Commission</strong>"), which may be calculated as a fixed fee, a percentage fee, a bonus or other payment depending upon a pre-selected program type (e.g., revenue share, pay per order or pay per member) (the "<strong>Program Type</strong>") and in accordance with certain rules ("<strong>Program Rules</strong>"). Each MEGA Site may have its own Program Rules, including rules for the manner and calculation of Commissions.</p>

<p>BY ACCEPTING THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THIS AGREEMENT, YOU REPRESENT THAT YOU ARE AT LEAST 18 YEARS OLD AND THE AGE OF MAJORITY AND LEGAL CONSENT IN THE JURISDICTION IN WHICH YOU LIVE OR RESIDE. YOU FURTHER CONSENT TO THE COLLECTION AND PROCESSING OF CERTAIN PERSONAL AND OTHER INFORMATION ABOUT YOU. THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THIS AGREEMENT MAY BE CHANGED AT ANY TIME BY US IN OUR DISCRETION, WITH OR WITHOUT NOTICE.</p>

We indicate at the top of the page when this Agreement was last updated. Your continued participation in the Affiliate Program following such changes will be deemed acceptance of such changes.

<h2>3. LIMITED LICENSE TO USE ADVERTISING ASSETS.</h2>

<p>Affiliate represents and warrants that it owns and/or operates the Affiliate Site and desires to place Advertising Assets on the Affiliate Site subject to the terms of this Agreement. MEGA makes Advertising Assets available to promote the services of one or more of the MEGA Sites. Advertising Assets are provided to an individual MEGA Site. Such Advertising Assets may contain logos, trademarks, service marks and/or identifying words for the MEGA Entities, MEGA Sites and their products and services ("<strong>MEGA Services</strong>"). You are granted a non-exclusive, non-transferable and revocable license to display these Advertising Assets throughout the Affiliate Site, subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and MEGA's policies and procedures. You may not alter, change, add to, or otherwise modify any Advertising Asset provided by us. This Agreement does not authorize the use of any Advertising Assets for any off-line or non-Internet (i.e., print) advertising or in the use of email marketing or other similar solicitations.</p>

<h2>4. AFFILIATE'S RESPONSIBILITY FOR AFFILIATE SITE AND CONTENT.</h2>

<p>You will be solely responsible and liable for the development, operation, maintenance and all materials and content that appears on the Affiliate Site. You shall operate and maintain the Affiliate Site in accordance with all applicable laws, rules and regulations. We reserve the right to monitor the Affiliate Site to determine if you are in compliance with this Agreement.</p>

<h2>5. MULTIPLE REFERRAL PROGRAM TYPES; MINIMUM THRESHOLD.</h2>

<p>As an Affiliate, you may participate in multiple Programs Types and be subject to one or more Commission rate schedules ("<strong>Schedules</strong>"). A current list of Programs Types and Schedules are posted on the applicable MEGA Site. Your participation in a specific Program Types may require you to meet minimum thresholds based upon various factors including, but not limited to, the duration, fees paid, conversion ratio, etc. Commissions may be modified for, or excluded from, certain trial, promotional and similar offers. The prices charged to customers of any MEGA Site are subject to change at any time. You may not include price information on the Affiliate Site related to any product or service provided by any MEGA Entity or MEGA Site. We will use reasonable efforts to present accurate information, but we cannot guarantee the availability or price of any particular product or service that we offer.</p>

<h2>6. SPECIAL LINKS ON AFFILIATE SITE; COMMISSION TRACKING AND REPORTING.</h2>

<p>Special Links permit accurate tracking, reporting, and accrual of your Commission. You may only earn a Commission with respect to activity on the MEGA Site occurring directly through Special Links. Special Links may be used alone or in combination with Advertising Assets. We will have no obligation to pay you a Commission if you fail to properly format the links as Special Links, including to the extent that such failure may result in any reduction of Commission fee amounts that would otherwise be paid to you under this Agreement.</p>

<p>Each MEGA Site uses commercially accepted methods and practices, which may include session or other types of cookies, to track a person's activities while on the MEGA Site. (To learn more about cookies, see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_cookie" target="_blank">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_cookie</a>.) Such methods and practices are designed to determine when an Action occurs. Unless otherwise expressly provided in the Program Rules for the Program Type, in order for a Commission to be earned, a person referred from the Affiliate Site to an MEGA Site must be tracked by such MEGA Site from the time the Special Link to the MEGA Site is activated (i.e., "clicked") until the person completes the member registration process and creates an account with such MEGA Site. We will not be liable to you or any other person for any Commissions or other amounts if we are unable to determine that an Action has occurred, whether due to a visitor's or member's browser settings, lack of PID or GPID, App bugs, antivirus software or otherwise. For purposes of illustration only, when cookies are used, the cookies are generally set to expire when a person using a MEGA Site terminates his or her browser session. If the cookie session expires before the creation of an account on such MEGA Site, you will not earn and will not be entitled to receive a Commission based upon any subsequent Actions taken by such person. If a person completes the member registration process and creates an account on one MEGA Site, you only receive a Commission for such person's subsequent Actions on the same MEGA Site, and not any other MEGA Site. For purposes of illustration only, if (a) a visitor is directed and comes to an MEGA Site from a Special Link on Site A, but does not complete the member registration process and create an account and then later returns to the MEGA Site from a Special Link from Site B and creates an account, no Commission is earned by or payable to Site A; or (b) if a visitor is directed and comes to an MEGA Site from Site A, but does not complete the membership registration process and create an account and later returns to the MEGA Site or another MEGA Site and creates an account, no Commission is earned by or payable to Site A.</p>

<p>MEGA takes commercially reasonable steps to provide you with online access to track and review (a) Actions resulting in Commissions taken by members directed to the MEGA Site by the Affiliate Site, (b) Commissions accrued, and (c) certain other information using MEGA's online reporting tools on a password-protected webpage (the "<strong>Reports Page</strong>"). The Reports Page is usually updated on a daily basis but is not in "real-time" and is subject to final reconciliation, taking into consideration non-completed transactions, Chargebacks, Credits and other potential charges. The form, content and frequency of the Reports Page remain subject to change.</p>

<h2>7. NO COMMISSION PAID.</h2>

<p>Not all paid products or services appearing on a given MEGA Site entitle you to a Commission. Any MEGA Entity may refuse to permit any person to establish an Account for any reason and may reject any Action that does not meet the MEGA Entity's requirements or policies and procedures in effect from time to time. For purposes of illustration only, an MEGA Entity may reject an order for goods or services based upon a credit card with insufficient funds. You shall not earn or be entitled to receive any Commission (a) attributable to any revenue collected by us arising out of any tax, royalty and/or duty that we, or those acting on our behalf, collect from any person using an MEGA Site, (b) paid by us for any SMS, merchant processing or similar fees or (c) results in Chargebacks or Credits.</p>

<h2>8. PAYMENT; COMMISSION PAYMENT FLOOR AND SETOFF.</h2>

<p>MEGA's current policy is to issue any Commission payments earned and owing in accordance with the Program Rules for the Program Type within approximately thirty (30) days following the end of the calendar month when the Commission was earned. All Commission are payable in EURO. To the extent we receive non-EURO currency for Actions, such currency will be converted into EURO in accordance with MEGA's exchange rate policies and procedures.</p>

<p>If the amount accrued to you for any payment of Commissions is less than the minimum amount established by us (the "<strong>Commission Payment Floor</strong>"), we will hold such payment until the payment period after the total amount accrued is at least equal to the Commission Payment Floor. The Commission Payment Floor is currently &euro; 50.00 and subject to change at any time or from time to time in our sole discretion. We will use commercially reasonable efforts to notify you of any such change in the Commission Payment Floor via email, posting a revised version of this Agreement, posting on the MEGA Site, or via other methods. If you have not earned or accrued referral fees in at least the amount of the Commission Payment Floor in the six (6) months prior to any given monthly payment period, or if your Account is suspended as provided herein, we reserve the right, in our sole discretion without notice to you, and without waiver by us, to charge you an Account maintenance fee in an amount up to &euro;50 per six (6) month period. The account maintenance fee charged may be deducted and offset against any unpaid Commissions.</p>

<p>If a Commission is paid or owed and a subsequent Chargeback or Credit occurs, MEGA may, in addition to any other remedies, terminate this Agreement for cause and/or setoff the amount of the Chargeback or Credit and any related fees from any subsequent payments owing to you. If there is no subsequent payment due, MEGA will send you an invoice for the amount of the setoff amount, and you agree to pay such invoice no later than thirty (30) days following receipt.</p>

<p>In the event that a check issued to you is voided and reissued, MEGA reserves the right to charge you a service fee. MEGA also reserves the right to void any check that has not been negotiated within six (6) months following the date of its issuance.</p>

<h2>9. TAX INFORMATION POLICY; SUSPENSION.</h2>

<p>Upon enrollment and completion of your Account as an Affiliate, you may be required to complete certain tax documents, (the "<strong>Required Tax Documentation</strong>"). MEGA may withhold all Commission payments owing to you until such time as you submit the completed Required Tax Documentation. During the period between when you enroll as an Affiliate and create and Account, and the time you submit the Required Tax Documentation, you may provide Special Links to the MEGA Sites from the Affiliate Site, Commissions will begin to accrue, and you may have access to the Reports Page. If you fail to submit the Required Tax Documentation within sixty (60) days of your enrollment and establishment of an Account, MEGA may suspend your Account until such time as you submit the Required Tax Documentation or, alternatively, MEGA may terminate this Agreement immediately and any Commissions accrued shall be forfeited.</p>

<h2>10. ORDER PROCESSING; OWNERSHIP OF CUSTOMER INFORMATION.</h2>

<p>The MEGA Entities and its service providers are solely responsible for processing and fulfilling all orders for customers of the MEGA Sites, including but not limited to, order entry, payment processing, shipping, cancellations, creditbacks, returns and related customer service. Visitors and members of the MEGA Sites will be considered customers of the applicable MEGA Entities for all purposes, and all MEGA Site terms, policies, rules and procedures will govern the customer relationship between the MEGA Entities and such customers. As between the parties, the MEGA Entities own any information pertaining to any person or customer who accesses any MEGA Site.</p>

<h2>11. NON-EXCLUSIVE LIMITED LICENSE TO USE MEGA MARKS.</h2>

<p>The applicable MEGA Entity grants you a non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable and limited license to use the logos, trade names, trademarks, service marks, and similar identifying material specified by such MEGA Entity on the applicable MEGA Site or in such MEGA Entity's Program Rules ("<strong>MEGA Marks</strong>") solely for the purpose of advertising the MEGA Services through the use of Advertising Assets in accordance with Section 3, subject to and in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. Without limiting the foregoing, you hereby agree:</p>

<p>b. to not use or place the MEGA Marks on or with any items or web pages or Apps that are injurious to end-users or their property, including but not limited to, items that could give rise to a claim for a breach of an express or implied warranty or product liability, or which is scandalous, libelous, obscene, violate intellectual property rights, or constitute an invasion of privacy or unauthorized use of likeness or otherwise unlawful or tortious;</p>

<p>h. not to use, register or file an application to register a trademark, service mark, domain name, user name, account name or other proprietary designation incorporating the MEGA Marks, or any variation of the MEGA Marks, whether they are used alone, in part, or in combination with other words or are based upon typographical errors or misspellings ("<strong>Prohibited Designation</strong>"); and</p>

<p>i. to notify MEGA promptly upon becoming aware of any improper use of the MEGA Marks and reasonably cooperate with MEGA (at MEGA's request) in the protection of the MEGA Marks.</p>

<p>You may only use the MEGA Marks to the extent that you advertise MEGA Services pursuant to this Agreement.

<p>ANY CLAIM, DISPUTE, OR CONTROVERSY (WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT, OR OTHERWISE, WHETHER PREEXISTING, PRESENT OR FUTURE, AND INCLUDING STATUTORY, CONSUMER PROTECTION, COMMON LAW, INTENTIONAL TORT AND EQUITABLE CLAIMS) BETWEEN AFFILIATE AND MEGA OR ANY OF OUR AFFILIATED ENTITIES OR OURS OR THEIR AGENTS, EMPLOYEES, PRINCIPALS, SUCCESSORS, OR ASSIGNS ARISING FROM OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, ITS INTERPRETATION, OR THE BREACH, TERMINATION OR VALIDITY HEREOF, OR THE RELATIONSHIPS WHICH RESULT FROM THIS AGREEMENT (INCLUDING, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, RELATIONSHIPS WITH THIRD PARTIES WHO ARE NOT SIGNATORIES TO THIS AGREEMENT), SHALL BE RESOLVED EXCLUSIVELY AND FINALLY BY BINDING ARBITRATION in Auckland, New Zealand. Any award of the arbitrator shall be final and binding on each of the parties, and may be entered as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction. Any and all disputes arising of this agreement, termination, or our relationship with you shall be determined by binding arbitration under the Arbitration Act 1996 in Auckland, New Zealand, by one arbitrator who shall be a lawyer knowledgable in relevant technology matters appointed by the President for the time being of the Arbitrators and Mediators Institute of New Zealand Incorporated (AMINZ) on a request by either you or us. Notice must be given to apply for any interim measure in the arbitration proceeding. The arbitration proceeding will commence when a request is made to AMINZ to appoint an arbitrator. The arbitration shall be in English. The Arbitrator in his or her discretion may permit the parties and witnesses to appear by videoconference. The relationship we have with you under these terms is governed by New Zealand law. You and we submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the New Zealand arbitral tribunals and courts (for the purposes of that arbitration) and the parties agree to enforcement of the arbitral award and orders in New Zealand and any other country.</p>

<p>The arbitration proceeding will be limited solely to the dispute or controversy between the parties. AFFILIATE ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT IS GIVING UP ITS RIGHT TO LITIGATE CLAIMS IN A COURT OR BEFORE A JURY WITH RESPECT TO ANY SUCH CLAIM. Nothing in this Section 27 shall be deemed to prohibit MEGA from seeking an injunction or other equitable relief in any court of competent jurisdiction to protect or preserve its or its licensors' intellectual property rights or rights in or to confidential information or to protect consumer data or trade secrets.</p>.

<h2>28. CLASS ACTION WAIVER.</h2>

<p>IN ANY DISPUTE, NEITHER AFFILIATE NOR ANY OTHER PERSON SHALL BE ENTITLED TO JOIN OR CONSOLIDATE CLAIMS BY OR AGAINST MEGA OR OTHER PERSONS, OR ARBITRATE ANY CLAIM AS A REPRESENTATIVE OR CLASS ACTION OR IN A PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL CAPACITY. AFFILIATE ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT IS GIVING UP ITS RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION WITH RESPECT TO ANY SUCH CLAIM.</p>
